WSU wolf researcher says legislators, university silenced, punished him for controversial research.

By a slow slide of river deep in Washington’s wolf country, Robert Wielgus laughs at the tattoo on his arm of 4 Claws: the grizzly that almost killed him.

“I would rather face charging grizzly bears trying to kill me than politicians and university administrators, because it is over quickly,” said Wielgus, a wolf researcher in the cross hairs of ranchers and GOP legislators, who since 2015 have silenced, de-funded and shut down his work, with the help of Washington State University administrators threatened over funding for a medical school and other pet projects, state records show.

Wielgus last April filed a complaint with the WSU Faculty Status Committee against WSU officials, including the university president and dean of the College of Agricultural, Human and Natural Resource Sciences (CAHNRS) alleging violations of his academic freedom. He also is contemplating a lawsuit against the university, which has yet to respond to his complaint.

WSU officials declined comment, citing possible litigation.

To understand just how Wielgus got so crosswise with ranchers, lawmakers and WSU administrators and their lobbyists involves a look at state policy concerning a menagerie of animals: cougars, sheep, cattle, and wolves.

It all started back in 2002, when Wielgus began publishing a series of influential papers that called into [question the practice of hunting cougars to reduce livestock losses.](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/is-cougar-hunting-breeding-chaos/)[His research helped overturn the state’s cougar hunting policy ](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/as-wolves-settle-in-the-states-cougars-to-pay-price/)with a dramatic reversal ordered by Gov. Jay Inslee in October, 2015.

But Wielgus was just getting started. That was just after he also published a peer reviewed paper that just as provocatively questioned killing wolves to protect livestock -- a policy used by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife by now to take aim at now [four wolf packs, including two members of the Smackout Pack killed so far this month.](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/states-wolf-kill-turns-up-the-heat-in-washington-cattle-country/)

The study published in PLoS ONE published December 3, 2014 [made national news](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/us/washington-state-study-faults-efforts-at-wolf-management.html). Normally for a university, that would be a point of pride. But for WSU lobbyists and administrators, when it came to wolves, no news was good news. Dan Coyne, a lobbyist for WSU, sounded the alarm two days after publication of the paper to Chris Mulick, director of state relations for WSU.

“I was in Blake’s office on other business this morning,” Coyne said in an email of Rep. Brian Blake, D-Aberdeen, chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources and the 2011 Farm Bureau Legislator of the Year.

“He brought wolves up to me...and the BOMB, Blake claims that highly ranked senators have said that the medical school and wolves are linked. If wolves continue to go poorly, there won’t be a new medical school, is what I took from the conversation.”

Jim Jesernig, another WSU lobbyist, a former director of the state Department of Agriculture, and member of the state House and Senate, agreed with Coyne, his partner at Coyne-Jesernig, their lobbying firm. “That’s my assessment as well,” Jesernig wrote in an email copied to Mulick. “Not only wolves are linked to the med school in the Senate but also the Yakima (water) storage study. We are making the med school not doable.”

Mulick also noted Blake had canceled a wolf work session on Wielgus’ research “to keep the temperature down.”

Mulick warned the director of university communications at the time “...the fact that it has shown up in so many national publications has made it notably worse. I think it would have been more manageable without such widespread placement. Again, this is my problem, it’s my job, and my lobbyists’ job, to take bullets over here. But we’re looking a wee bit like Sonny on the causeway here,” Mulick said, referring to a mob hit on a victim in the movie, The Godfather. “We’re getting in our own way on the med school enough as it is.”

A magazine story prepared by a WSU science writer in advance of the PLoS ONE paper was spiked. Just like a press release subsequently written, but never issued on new cougar research out of Wielgus’s lab.

“I am asking that you delay this press release - please do NOT release this,” wrote Ron Mittelhammer, a WSU professor of statistics and then an interim co-provost, wrote to a WSU communications office staffer in an email on Oct 30, 2015. “Our government relations staff have advised that this could potentially create substantial difficulties for the CAHNRS and WSU.” The press release never ran.

“WTF? What happened?” wrote Jon Keehner, co-author on the paper, to Wielgus. “WSU is afraid of pissing off the republicans in WA.,” Wielgus explained in an email October 31, 2015. “My name is ...he who must never be mentioned,” Wielgus wrote Keehner. “Even my $600,000 grants are not in my name. They are given to another WSU prof...just to hide the fact that I exist at WSU. I no longer attend any WDFW functions either. Everyone still works with me and funds me...but behind the curtain. I have become the Wizard of Oz.”

By then, lawmakers in Olympia had stripped him of his principal investigator status on the grant funding for his wolf research, and funneled the money to the university under the name of another professor.

“That’s how bad it got,” John Pierce, director of research for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said in an interview. Losing principal investigator status on a grant is a wound in academia, Pierce explained, where the ability to bring in grant money is a coin of the realm. Winning grants attracts top graduate students, and also helps researchers compete for more grants.

In particular, Wielgus had provoked Rep. Joel Kretz, R-Wauconda, a former Bellevue resident turned cougar hunter, elected to the legislature to represent the remote 7th district of Stevens county.

Known for carrying the severed heads of cougars to public meetings, and even plucking one from his home freezer to sit, defrosting, on a table between himself and a newspaper reporter at his ranch during an interview, Kretz butted heads with Wielgus from his first cougar papers that had thwarted Kretz’s efforts to increase cougar hunting in Northeastern Washington.

It was an animosity that would turn more extreme. In August, 2016, Wielgus inflamed the debate over the state’s kill policy on wolves when he told the Seattle Times and other media outlets that Len McIrvin, who runs one of the state’s largest cattle ranch operations, had put his cattle out [“on top of a wolf den.”](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/profanity-peak-wolf-pack-in-states-gun-sights-after-rancher-turns-out-cattle-on-den/)

The remark ignited a fire storm. Tens of thousands of angry emails and phone calls from wolf advocates poured into the offices of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Colville National Forest, [where many ranchers’ allotments are located](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/with-their-cattle-grazing-in-washingtons-wolf-country-ranchers-work-and-worry/). Donny Martorello, the department’s wolf policy lead, hid his wife in a motel. McIrvin’s family unplugged the phone at the ranch to escape death threats.

Kretz, incensed, demanded an apology from WSU just as public as the remarks Wielgus had made -- and got it. The university issued a press release the next day [disassociating itself from Wielgus](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/claim-that-rancher-turned-out-wolves-on-den-untrue-wsu-says/), and asserting Wielgus had admitted he had no basis in fact for his statements.

In a letter of concern also written to his file, Wielgus was instructed to have no further contact with the media without first clearing his statements with WSU. Wielgus went silent as the furor raged.

“He ought to be drawn and quartered and a chunk of him left everywhere in the district,” Kretz said in an interview then with the Seattle Times, saying Wielgus had implied the rancher purposely put his animals in harm’s way to provoke the state’s ensuing kill of the Profanity Peak pack to defend the cattle.

“I have talked with WSU over the years, I think he is agenda driven, it’s incredible damage,” Kretz said. “This is not science, it is advocacy. I would say it’s beyond advocacy, it’s bald faced lying to the public. I don’t want to see a nickel go through his hands.”

But Wielgus, who received tenure from WSU in October, 28, 2016, would not remain quiet about what happened for long. And state records reveal WDFW shares part of the blame for the fate of the Profanity Peak Pack.

State biologists collared wolves in the Profanity Peak pack on June 9 and 12, just as McIrvin turned out his cattle on June 9. The department knew the cattle were overlapping the wolves’ territory -- not unusual, or problematic in Washington, where wolves typically share the landscape with livestock without incident. By the end of June, the department knew where the den site was, too -- about four miles from where McIrvin had turned out his cattle -- but didn’t tell him.

McIrvin has held permits to graze the Colville National Forest for 73 years. He turned out 198 cows with calves on one of five allotments he uses, just as in the past. McIrvin said in an interview he did not know that his cattle were drifting toward the den of the Profanity Peak pack. The wolves, burned out of their territory in the 2015 Stickpin Fire, had moved their den that year into the heart of Colville National Forest, overlapping multiple grazing allotments used by McIrvin and other ranchers.

Before long, the wolves were killing calves anywhere from one to more than ten miles from the initial turn out location and den site.

Yet the department didn’t urge McIrvin to get range riders out on his allotment until after the first calf was killed July 8. And while the department initially assured the public McIrvin was following its recommended protocol of turning out calves at least 200 pounds or larger, it later revealed that some animals were smaller.

It also wasn’t until August that the department alerted McIrvin’s range rider, Arron Scotten, that the salt block put out as usual to entice the cattle to higher ground in the mountain pastures of the Colville National Forest, was in the heart of the pack’s activity area.

Ranch hands had put out the salt in the same location for decades to utilize the knowledge of older cows that lead the young ones through the pastures’ grazing rotation. But in 2016, the salt was about 200 yards from the pack’s new den.

For wolves that typically range over a territory of more than 350 square miles, four miles was nothing and 200 yards was nothing. The cows were in the heart of their activity area.

Scotten said once alerted by the state, he moved the salt -- but that was long after the wolves had started killing calves -- and after the state started killing off the pack. Ironically, moving the salt made the problem worse, Scotten said. Cattle that usually would have just licked the salt and moved on hung around, pawing the ground, looking for the salt that was supposed to be there.

The kill operation went slowly, with state helicopter gunners eventually killing six adult wolves and a pup. A trapper hired for more than $9,000 from Oct. 4-14 never caught a single wolf. All told, the kill operation cost $134,999 -- many times the $39,315 the feds would earn in grazing fees that year for the entire 39 allotments grazed in the Colville National Forest.

In all, state and federal managers say wolves and cattle are coexisting well in Washington, with wolf populations going up 30 percent a year, and a small number of livestock killed or injured (only 15 by the department’s confirmed count) with 4,434 cow and calf pairs grazing in the Colville National Forest alone in 2016.

Wielgus too said he is optimistic wolves will recover in Washington. He doesn’t think the same for himself.

“They called me a liar and ruined my career,” he said of WSU.

He maintains today that while he could have been more diplomatic -- his public remarks included saying “wherever McIrvin goes, dead wolves follow. Quote me. He’ll love it!” -- he had told the truth all along: the cows essentially were on top of the wolves’ den, and the salt blocks only worsened the situation. The press release disavowing his statements was never shown to him, Wielgus said, and misconstrued a short conversation by phone between him and Mittelhammer over the weekend, Wielgus said.

His conflicts with the university would continue. In March, Wielgus received a second “letter of concern” from WSU administrators, after he emailed a press release reporting the latest findings from his [Large Carnivore Lab ](https://environment.wsu.edu/people/)to the state’s wolf advisory committee as it formulated wolf policy for 2017.

Wolf kills of livestock were exceedingly rare, Wielgus reported, occurring in fewer than 1 percent of the collared livestock his lab tracked in the largest study of its kind. Only in the case of the Profanity Peak Pack, where cattle and a salt block to attract them were right next to a den site and activity area had there been multiple calf kills, dramatically more than anywhere else surveyed, Wielgus reported.

He had sent the release to WSU administrators for approval as requested, then sent it to members of the press and wolf advisory committee. Only then did he get further instruction from Mittelhammer, by then dean of the agriculture school, that it should be sent on his personal email, not from his WSU account.

When Wielgus asked to address the advisory group, Tom Davis of the Washington Farm Bureau and a member of the Wolf Advisory Group complained to Mulick, insisting he not participate. “His tactics and antics are well known,” said Davis, who vowed that if Wielgus was allowed to address the group, he would not participate.

Mittelhammer disallowed Wielgus’s participation, and issued a press release once again dismissing Wielgus’s comments that had been approved by the school’s communication office. He also vowed in the press release to initiate a review to determine whether Wielgus had violated university polices or state laws law related to lobbying use of public resources.

WSU administrators met with Kretz to discuss the issue in April, and later wrote Kretz, and other GOP lawmakers, “the deliberations of th WAG were fortunately not significantly affected by Dr. Wielgus’ attempt to influence the groups deliberations,” however, “the document reinvigorated negative feelings toward ranchers by wolf protectionists.”

Later the same month Mittelhammer also followed up with a letter to Kretz and Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, the senate majority leader, with a promise to investigate the science underlying Wielgus’s peer-reviewed paper, following a complaint by Kretz about its accuracy.

WSU kept working to appease the ranchers,too. In May, WSU president Kirk Schulz met personally for 20 minutes with Scotten, who warned him “that WSU may be branded with a “anti-ranching sentiment” because of comments made by Prof. (Wielgus.)...he really wants WSU to be a partner.”

On May 10, Schulz delivered, writing Mittelhammer with concerns about the ranching industry. “I feel that they need an internal champion or person that they can work with.”

After all that, on May 29, Christopher Keane, vice president for research at WSU wrote Kretz and Schoesler thanking them for meeting in Olympia with top WSU brass to express concern about Wielgus’s research, and the result of the subsequent independent review ordered by a WSU statistician: “There is no evidence of misconduct in this matter.”

But for faculty at WSU, the message nonetheless was clear, said Donna Potts, president of the local chapter of the American Association of University Professors, the nation’s oldest and largest advocacy group for academic freedom. “It was very disturbing, I had never seen anything like it,” said Potts, who is a member of the English department.

Cary Nelson, former national president of the AAUP, who spoke on the issue at WSU last spring, said pressure from industry and lawmakers friendly to it is nothing unusual. “But it up to a university to protect its faculty.” He said he had not heard of a professor stripped of principal investigator status before by politicians. “That is very unusual.”

Actions by state lawmakers and WSU administrators such as those taken against Wielgus have a “chilling effect” on research that could be perceived as controversial, Nelson said.

In an interview, Kretz dismissed the PEER complaint. “That’s what they do,” he said of PEER. He confirmed that he was withholding money from WSU to the best of his ability, and would continue to do so.

From research on wolves, to organic agriculture, to greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoirs behind dams, the university’s research is “off track,” Kretz said. “I won’t fund them at all.” Ditto for Wielgus, he said.

Hans Dunshee, a former Snohomish Democrat and top budget writer said he cut the deal with Kretz to sidestep Wielgus from the wolf research grant, to fund the work through another researcher’s name. “It was our way of sanitizing it while still keeping the money flowing,” said Dunshee, who retired from the legislature last year. “I thought he was going to be OK.”

But he wasn’t. Wielgus lost his summer research funding for two years, his travel budget for scientific conferences, and was required to clear any presentations he did make first with WSU administrators.

Scientists who have worked with Wielgus said they are concerned by what they see.

“It’s not that Rob hasn’t stirred up the hornets’ nest, he can test the limits and some people think he is not very diplomatic,” said Gary Koehler of Wenatchee, who collaborated with Wielgus on bear and cougar research before retiring from the department after 14 years. “But he is a straight shooter.

“There is obviously a lot of politics at play here, and unfortunately, that is the end game for a lot of wildlife issues, particularly for controversial species such as a large carnivore that may have conflict with people. How to deal with the public, that is where politics starts to enter into the mix.

“Rob is without a doubt one of the top carnivore ecologists in North America. I think Rob has been thrown under the bus.”
