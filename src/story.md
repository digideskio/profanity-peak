By a slow slide of river deep in Washington’s wolf country, Robert Wielgus laughs at the tattoo on his arm of 4 Claws, the grizzly that almost killed him.

“I would rather face charging grizzly bears trying to kill me than politicians and university administrators, because it is over quickly,” said Wielgus, a Washington State University wolf researcher.

A Harley-riding, self-described adrenaline junkie at home in black motorcycle leathers with a Stetson and a .357 in the pickup, Wielgus is no tweed-jacket academic. For decades he has traveled North America wrangling bears, cougars and wolves to collar and study their behavior, including collaborations with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW).

Wielgus now finds himself crosswise with ranchers, lawmakers and WSU administrators — and their lobbyists. He’s lost grant funding and been shut out of his summer research, forbidden from talking to media in his professional role and investigated — and cleared — for scientific misconduct.

To understand why involves a look at state policy concerning a menagerie of animals: cougars, sheep, cattle and wolves. And one more animal: homo sapiens.

In Washington, it turns out, wolves and livestock are getting along better than the people who manage and study them.

Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), a national non-profit specializing in government scientist whistleblower protection, in April [filed a 12-page complaint](https://www.peer.org/news/press-clips/researcher-files-complaint-against-wsu.html)against WSU officials, alleging the university punished and silenced Wielgus to placate ranchers and state legislators who objected to his research. WSU officials declined to comment for this story, citing possible litigation.

The conflict started back in 2002, when Wielgus began publishing a series of influential papers that called into [question the practice of hunting cougars to reduce livestock losses.](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/is-cougar-hunting-breeding-chaos/) His research led to a reversal by Gov. Jay Inslee in October 2015 of Fish and Wildlife Commission [policy that would have allowed more hunting](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/as-wolves-settle-in-the-states-cougars-to-pay-price/).

That was not long after Wielgus published a peer-reviewed paper that just as provocatively questioned killing wolves to protect livestock — a policy used by the WDFW by now to take aim at [four wolf packs, including two members of the Smackout Pack killed so far this month.](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/states-wolf-kill-turns-up-the-heat-in-washington-cattle-country/)

His wolf study [made national news](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/us/washington-state-study-faults-efforts-at-wolf-management.html) with its finding that culling the predators can lead to more livestock kills, not fewer, because it destablizes pack dynamics.

Normally for a university, national press for one of its researchers would be a point of pride. But the buzz over the paper alarmed lobbyists for WSU, hearing threats from state lawmakers that it was putting money for a new medical school and other pet projects in jeopardy.

Those legislators in turn were responding to ranchers and local officials seeking more lethal action from the department against wolves that harm livestock.

“ ... Highly ranked senators have said that the medical school and wolves are linked. If wolves continue to go poorly, there won’t be a new medical school,” Dan Coyne, lobbyist for WSU, wrote his colleague, Jim Jesernig, another WSU lobbyist, two days after the paper’s publication.

Jesernig, a well-connected former director of the state Department of Agriculture, and former member of the state House and Senate, agreed with Coyne, his partner at Coyne, Jesernig lobbying firm. “That’s my assessment as well,” Jesernig wrote in an email copied to WSU Director of State Relations Chris Mulick. “... We are making the med school not doable.”

Replied Mulick, “...we’re looking a wee bit like Sonny on the causeway here,” referring to a mob hit on a victim in the movie “The Godfather.” “We’re getting in our own way on the med school enough as it is.”

A magazine story prepared by a WSU communications department writer in advance of the wolf paper was spiked, Wielgus said. Just like a news release subsequently written, but never issued, on new cougar research out of Wielgus’ lab.

“WTF? What happened?” wrote Jon Keehner, co-author on that paper, to Wielgus.

Wielgus answered that the university was afraid of angering Republicans. He explained grant funds for his wolf work were now being funneled to his lab through another researcher, to take his name off the grant.

“That’s how bad it got,” John Pierce, director of research for the WDFW, said in an interview. Losing so-called principal investigator status on a grant is a wound in academia, Pierce explained, where the ability to bring in grant money is a coin of the realm. Winning grants attracts top graduate students and helps researchers compete for more grants.

In particular, Wielgus had provoked Rep. Joel Kretz, R-Wauconda, a former Mercer Island resident turned cougar hunter, elected to the Legislature to represent the remote 7th district of Stevens County.

Known for carrying the severed heads of cougars to public meetings — even plucking one for effect from his home freezer to sit, defrosting, on a table between himself and this reporter during an interview at his ranch — Kretz had butted heads with Wielgus from his first cougar papers that had thwarted Kretz’s efforts to increase cougar hunting in Northeastern Washington.

He attacked Wielgus’ wolf research, questioning its scientific validity to WSU officials, and opposed further funding for Wielgus.

Hans Dunshee, a former Snohomish Democrat and top budget writer confirmed he cut a deal with Kretz in 2015 to sidestep Wielgus from the wolf research grant. “It was our way of sanitizing it while still keeping the money flowing,” said Dunshee, who retired from the legislature last year. “I thought he was going to be OK.”

But he wasn’t.

Knocked off the grant, Wielgus lost his summer salary for two years — during the peak season for wolf research — and his travel budget.

In the end, [money got tucked in for the medical school](https://spokane.wsu.edu/extra/2015/06/30/we-did-it-wsu-medical-school-funding-approved/), in the same budget that sidestepped the funding for Wielgus. The school will begin its first classes this fall.

Jesernig, in an interview, recalled well the trouble wolves caused as he worked the medical school issue for WSU.

“It’s not a great secret; it happens to any lobbyist, you have a bill you work and all of a sudden you are in trouble with leadership, same thing here,” Jerserig said. “At the end of the day the good thing about the legislative process is mostly the merits of the issue will win out on the thing you are working on, and that is what happened on the medical school.”

Already targeted for his wolf research, Wielgus poured gas on the fire last summer.

As the Profanity Peak pack started killing cows and the state launched a trapper and marksmen on the ground and in helicopters to protect the rancher’s cattle, Wielgus told The Seattle Times and other media outlets that Len McIrvin, a partner in the Diamond M, “chose to put his cattle [on top of the den site](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/profanity-peak-wolf-pack-in-states-gun-sights-after-rancher-turns-out-cattle-on-den/).”

The implication that the rancher — whose livestock losses in 2012 also led to the state killing [the Wedge pack](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/state-learns-sad-lesson-with-wedge-pack-wolf-hunt/) — purposely put his animals in harm’s way to provoke the state’s ensuing kill of the Profanity Peak pack ignited a fire storm.

<?<%= markdown.mountain %>?>

Thousands of angry emails and phone calls from wolf advocates poured into the offices of the WDFW and the Colville National Forest, [home to many ranchers’ grazing allotments](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/with-their-cattle-grazing-in-washingtons-wolf-country-ranchers-work-and-worry/). Donny Martorello, the department’s wolf-policy lead, hid his wife in a motel. McIrvin’s family unplugged the phone at the ranch to escape death threats.

Kretz, incensed, demanded an apology from WSU just as public as the remarks Wielgus had made — and got it. The university quickly issued a news release [disassociating itself from Wielgus](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/claim-that-rancher-turned-out-wolves-on-den-untrue-wsu-says/) and asserting Wielgus had admitted he had no basis in fact for his statements.

In a letter of concern written into his personnel his file, Wielgus was instructed by Ron Mittelhammer, the dean of the College of Agriculture, Human and Natural Resource Sciences to have no further contact with the media without first clearing his statements with WSU. Wielgus duly went silent as the furor raged.

“He ought to be drawn and quartered and a chunk of him left everywhere in the district,” Kretz said in an interview then with The Seattle Times, saying Wielgus had a vendetta against McIrvin.

“I think he is agenda-driven, it’s incredible damage,” Kretz said. “This is not science, it is advocacy. I would say it’s beyond advocacy, it’s bald-faced lying to the public. I don’t want to see a nickel go through his hands.”

Wielgus says today that he could have been more diplomatic; his public remarks included saying “go ahead and quote me: ‘Wherever McIrvin grazes, dead wolves follow.’ Quote me. He’ll be proud of it!”

The ranchers had turned out their cows and placed a salt lick for them in the same locations used for decades. But that year, burned out by the Stickpin fire, the wolves had moved their den to within five miles of the turnout site and a quarter-mile from the salt lick, in a forested, off-road location.

The WDFW knew about the den by the end of that June, but gave Diamond M operators no information about the Profanity Peak pack’s movements or den site. Wolves travel a territory of more than 350 miles, and the cows, following their usual grazing paths through pastures of the alottment into the mountains, soon dispersed from the drop-off site into the pack’s core activity area. By July 8, the pack killed its first calf — and kept at it, even after the WDFW responded and began killing the pack.

The WDFW carried on most of the summer and into the fall killing wolves, eventually taking the lives of six adults and a pup in the pack. All told, the department spent $134,999 on the operation.

For all the controversy, Wielgus said he is still optimistic wolves will recover from local extinction in Washington. He doesn’t think the same for himself.

The news release disavowing his statements was never shown to him, Wielgus said, and misconstrued a short conversation by phone between him and Mittelhammer.

While he has since attained tenure, Wielgus said he no longer wants to work at the university. “They called me a liar and ruined my career.”

Wielgus’ conflicts with the university would continue. In March, he received a second “letter of concern” from Mittelhammer, after he emailed a news release reporting the latest findings from his [Large Carnivore Lab ](https://environment.wsu.edu/people/)to the state’s wolf advisory committee as it formulated wolf policy for 2017.

Wolf kills of livestock were exceedingly rare, Wielgus reported, occurring in fewer than 1 percent of the livestock tracked by his lab. Only in the case of the Profanity Peak Pack, where cattle and a salt block to attract them were milling around the wolves’ activity area, had there been multiple calf kills, more than anywhere else surveyed, Wielgus reported.

Wielgus had sent the release to WSU communications staff and administrators for pre-approval, putting it out as his personal opinion and not on behalf of the university, as they requested. But after sending it to members of the press and advisory committee, he got further instruction from Mittelhammer that it should be sent from his personal email, not from his WSU account, emails between the two show.

<? <%= t.include("./previously.html")%> ?>

When Wielgus asked to address the Wolf Advisory Group, Tom Davis of the Washington Farm Bureau and a member of the group, complained to Mulick, insisting he shut Wielgus down. “His tactics and antics are well known,” said Davis, who vowed that if Wielgus was allowed to address the group, he would not participate.

Mittelhammer disallowed Wielgus’s participation, then issued a news release dismissing Wielgus’s comments that had been previously approved by the school’s communication office. He also told reporters the agriculture school would investigate whether Wielgus had violated university policies or state law related to lobbying or inappropriate use of public resources.

In May, Schulz informed Mittelhammer he was concerned WSU may be branded with an “anti-ranching sentiment.”

In another email, the university president told the agriculture school dean he wanted the school’s relationship with ranchers addressed in future hires. “I feel that they need an internal champion or person that they can work with.”

By then, WSU had cleared Wielgus of any scientific wrongdoing. On May 29, Christopher Keane, the vice president for research at WSU, wrote Kretz and Sen. Mark Schoesler, senate majority leader, thanking them for meeting with him in Olympia to express concern about Wielgus’s research.

However, the result of the subsequent independent review completed by a WSU statistician was clear: “There is no evidence of misconduct in this matter,” Keane wrote.

But for faculty at WSU, the message nonetheless was clear, said Donna Potts, president of the local chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), the nation’s oldest and largest advocacy group for academic freedom. “It was very disturbing, I had never seen anything like it,” Potts, a member of the English department, said of WSU’s treatment of a senior faculty member.

Cary Nelson, former national president of the AAUP, who spoke on the issue at WSU last spring, said pressure from industry and from lawmakers friendly to it is nothing unusual. “But it up to a university to protect its faculty.”

Actions by state lawmakers and WSU administrators such as those taken against Wielgus have a “chilling effect” on research that could be perceived as controversial, Nelson said.

Scientists who have worked with Wielgus said they are concerned by what they see.

“It’s not that Rob hasn’t stirred up the hornets’ nest — he can test the limits and some people think he is not very diplomatic,” said Gary Koehler of Wenatchee, who collaborated with Wielgus on bear and cougar research before retiring from the department after 14 years. “But he is a straight shooter.

“Rob is without a doubt one of the top carnivore ecologists in North America. I think Rob has been thrown under the bus.”
