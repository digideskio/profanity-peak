State biologists collared wolves in the Profanity Peak pack on June 9 and 12, 2016. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife knew 11 ranchers’ grazing allotments overlapped the pack’s territory &mdash; not unusual or problematic in Washington, where wolves typically share the landscape with livestock without incident.

The McIrvin family and Diamond M Ranch have held their grazing permits in the Colville National Forest for 73 years. But what the ranchers and department did not know was the Profanity Peak pack, burned out of its territory in the 2015 Stickpin Fire, had moved its den in 2016 into the heart of one the Diamond M allotments.

By the end of June, the department, using collar data, knew where the den site was: about 5 miles from where the Diamond M had turned out 198 cows and 198 calves on June 9. The ranchers figured out the den site location on their own at the same time, because of all the wolf howling, tracks and scat they noticed while checking on their cattle. They also were informed of the location by the department.

Before long, the wolves were killing calves anywhere from 1 to more than 10 miles from the initial turnout location and den site.

Wolves typically range over an average territory of 349 square miles, and the Diamond M cows were soon in the heart of the Profanity Peak Pack’s core activity area.

The department didn’t urge Diamond M operators to increase human presence with their cattle with range riders until after the first calf was killed July 8. While the department initially assured the public that the Diamond M was following its recommended protocol of turning out calves at least 200 pounds or larger, it later revealed that some animals were smaller.
