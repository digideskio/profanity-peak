State biologists collared wolves in the Profanity Peak pack on June 9 and 12, just as McIrvin turned out his cattle on June 9. The department knew the cattle were overlapping the wolves’ territory -- not unusual, or problematic in Washington, where wolves typically share the landscape with livestock without incident.

By the end of June, the department knew where the den site was, too -- about four miles from where McIrvin had turned out his cattle -- but didn’t tell him.

McIrvin has held permits to graze the Colville National Forest for 73 years. He turned out 198 cows with calves on one of five allotments he uses, just as in the past. McIrvin said in an interview he did not know that his cattle were drifting toward the den of the Profanity Peak pack. The wolves, burned out of their territory in the 2015 Stickpin Fire, had moved their den that year into the heart of Colville National Forest, overlapping multiple grazing allotments used by McIrvin and other ranchers.

Before long, the wolves were killing calves anywhere from one to more than ten miles from the initial turn out location and den site.

Yet the department didn’t urge McIrvin to get range riders out on his allotment until after the first calf was killed July 8. And while the department initially assured the public McIrvin was following its recommended protocol of turning out calves at least 200 pounds or larger, it later revealed that some animals were smaller.

It also wasn’t until August that the department alerted McIrvin’s range rider, Arron Scotten, that the salt block put out as usual to entice the cattle to higher ground in the mountain pastures of the Colville National Forest, was in the heart of the pack’s activity area.

Ranch hands had put out the salt in the same location for decades to utilize the knowledge of older cows that lead the young ones through the pastures’ grazing rotation. But in 2016, the salt was about 200 yards from the pack’s new den.

For wolves that typically range over a territory of more than 350 square miles, four miles was nothing and 200 yards was nothing. The cows were in the heart of their activity area.
